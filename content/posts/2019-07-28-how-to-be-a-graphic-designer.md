This is what I used to search in google when I first got into the field and found my passion in it.

Going into the design field was very exciting for me, but not having a design background was somehow scary, I thought there will always be something missing.

So, first I took a graphic design diploma, to learn the basic needs and how to use the tools, so I knew the basics I need, then I felt in love with illustration art, but what to do next?

After the diploma, I felt lost, because I didn't know what to do next, so I started reading a lot about designing, and how to be good in it without degree but I found that it doesn't matter as long as your work is creative and good.

The only thing that really matters is your passion about what you do, studying hard, reading a lot and practice, practice, practice.

Self learning was great, but I wanted more, I needed a mentor to guide and help me work on real projects to know what's out there, so I found an internship in branding company, but that's a different topic.
