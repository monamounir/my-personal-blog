Watching tutorials helps to improve your skills a lot, also as making projects on your own to learn from them, but for me it wasn't enough, I wanted to have a mentor someone who has been a designer for a long time to help me specially as I'm starting my career.



So I looked for an internship, I searched on designers facebook groups and I googled designers internships in Egypt, I found a lot of options, so I communicated with what fit me I sent my portfolio.



when I went to the interview I was afraid to be under qualified because all I did till now was projects on my own and from tutorials, but i shouldn't have been scared as I'm only applying for an internship and as long as I know the basics and how to use the tools then it's all good. 



The only thing you should know as an intern is the basics and show them enthusiasm and passion to learn, so that's what I did at the interview I told them I want a mentor, I want to work on real projects with other designers and and showed them the passion I have for graphic design and that's how I got my internship.



P.S: I will share with you what I did in the internship week by week in different articles.
