Estkana is the second project I worked on in the internship, it's a facebook page interested in food, it reviews the restaurants, recommend it and share their food experience to help you find what's best for you.



First thing to do was taking brief from the marketing team about the project as they wanted a logo for the page, so you need to ask about details to help you with the design process and to understand the project for example they said Estkana means kind of tea you  drink after a heavy meal.



Then comes the research, I searched for logo designs related to food, and searched for the meaning and history of Estkana and found that it evolved from east tea can.



After the brief and the research I got an idea about the first concept of the logo, I wanted to replace the last two letters with a tea pot, so I started sketching the  idea and illustrate it, it took a lot of stages/steps to reach the final logo that to me serve the objective of the page and also was accepted by both the art director and marketing team.

This was the first concept and I wanted to make different concepts/typography type for the logo so I tried sketching it using symmetrical shapes, and I made another two versions for the logo.

The last stage was the presentation to the marketing team as I show them to the art director before the final stage and she had some notices so I worked on them but as presenting them to the marketing team you should describe the concept of the logo and the choice of colors for example orange color for energy and enthusiasm which are the feelings you want people to get from the Estkana page.
