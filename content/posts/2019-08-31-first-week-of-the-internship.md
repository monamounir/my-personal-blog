The first week of the internship was very exciting for me, I wanted to prove myself and to show them the passion I have for graphic design.

We started by introducing ourselves, they talked to us about marketing but that was only in the first week, but for the rest of the internship the art director talked to us about branding, visuals and anything else we wanted to know about graphic design.

On the first week we were split into two teams, each team had both designers and marketers to work together on the first task.

The first task was to come up with idea about restaurant, we were told to create it from scratch, stating from how it would look like, where is it going to be, the name of it, etc..

After we came up with every detail about the restaurant, we presented the idea, then we had another task as a designer I was told to create a logo.

The restaurant name is Healthholic, it's a healthy/vegetarian restaurant, so the first thing I did after having the brief was research about other logos for healthy food restaurants and companies, after seeing the logo and getting inspired I started sketching, then after coming up with some ideas I started to apply them on Illustrator.

I came up with 3 version for the logo, but the one in the first image is my favorite as it represent the idea in a better way, I replaced the letter i with the branch and the leaves to give the impression of a healthy food, also in the second and third logos I used vectors from freepik, so I would prefer the logo to be more original and unique, that's why it's better to be created from scratch.

So that's the story of the first week project in the internship and the rest of the projects will be in separated articles.
