Belkaf is the first home made project I worked on with my husband, it's basically an application that organizes the books in our library, help us find new books and we can see our friends' library to borrow from them or they can borrow from us as well.



The first thing I did was research about similar applications and look for logos similar to the same idea, the research is very important step so you can get inspired and also to create something new.



After the research I started sketching some ideas for the logo, I tried to create icon and get some ideas for the logo before trying it on illustrator, the next step is to take the ideas to illustrator, I wanted to create the logo from scratch I didn't want to use fonts that already exist, so I created it from symmetrical circles and lines.



There was a lot of drafts first until I was happy with the final logo, the logo also has a book icon in the middle to go with the main idea of the app, then after the logo I made some designs to present it in a cool way and to put it on Behance as full project.
